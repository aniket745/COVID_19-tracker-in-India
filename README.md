## Introduction
1. The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
2. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020.
3. As of 16 Jun 2020, total confirmed cases are 3,35,407, active cases are 1,45,494, recoveries are 1,80,494  and 9,900 deaths occurred in the country.

In this project I have done visualization of COVID-19 spread in India using Tableau. I have ploted meaningful graphs based on problem statement.

## Problem Statement
1. Changes in number of confirmed, active, deaths, recovered cases over time 
2. Impact of Lockdown on spread of COVID-19  
3. Daily growth in active, deaths, recovered cases
4. State wise distribution of confirmed cases
5. Hotspots in India
6.Active/Recovered/Deaths occurred state wise
7. State wise sample testing

Based on the graphs I have made some conclusions.

## Conclusion
1. During 1st 3 phases of lockdown spread of COVID-19 was in control
2. Relaxation in lockdown give rise to spread of COVID-19
3. Daily growth in active & recovered cases is linear
4. Maharashtra is highly affected by COVID-19
5. Approx. half of the cases of Maharashtra are in Mumbai
6. Tamil Nadu tested highest samples followed by Maharashtra 
7. Andhra Pradesh has nearly 6.5k confirmed cases, but they tested nearly 567k samples
8. Also Rajasthan has nearly 13k confirmed cases, but they tested nearly 609k samples
